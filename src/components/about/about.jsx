              I am a young software engineer training at the Faculty of
              Engineering and Technology(FET) of the University of Buea . I am to get
              my B.eng in 2025. Being on demand for experience, I apply to
               
              today, I learned technologies such as react, react native,Node js, in
              short the MERN stack, I am still learning and counting on the
              support of Camsol to increase my knowledge at end of being an
              engineer not only graduate, but also qualified. I hold a
              French-speaking GCE O-level A-grade, my university studies at
              FET I did in English and French too. I can therefore express myself in French (Fairly-good) and
              in English (OK) .
